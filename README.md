# Practice Mode:
This is the practice mode. I use this method every time I practice. It's also the only mode, with expection to the first time I do a step. When doing a step for the first time, I simply try to reproduce that step without looking at the solution.<br>
In this video everything I type is completely from memory. The only thing I read are the instructions of a given step. In this video, I will be doing ***section 5 step 3***. Again, Every thing I type is straight from memory because I have already done step 3 in section 5. **For example:** Step 3 requires to use a ***toolbar button***. From doing this step before, I know that to create a ***toolbar button*** I need to use the ***.toolbar{} container*** etc.... I have also done the tutorial from the 2nd link and so I use the stuff I remember from that tutorial to help me when completing other tutorials. After trying to complete a step, I check with the "solution" which are on the right side of the instructions. If I get even one thing wrong I mark it with an [x] i.e: /***toolbar ScrollView attribute->done right[x]***/. ***NOTE: I am going to intentionally make a mistake to to show this***. When doing a step for the first time, I try to see if I can complete the step without using the solution(right side of the instructions)by relying on the other tutorials I've done. It is important to ***note*** that I do the sections and steps in order. That is, if a step I'm doing uses a variable but none of the steps I've done so far showed how to create that variable I will not use that variable. Instead, I will use something like /*TODO*/ or ?. I'll also show Section 4 steps 2-4. Note that the code that i have is missing a ZStack container while the sample/solution has a ZStack container. This is because the ZStack is mentioned in step 5 and the code is for steps 2-4. This is the last thing I will show in the video.

# Up And Down shortcuts: 
***The following steps will help you set up keyboard shortcuts for going up and down a file :***<br>
Inside vscode with any file open press: 
    ***ctrl+shift+p***<br>
Inside the "search bar" that opens type:<br>
    ***keyboard shortcuts json***<br>
Click on that option which will open a file called ***keybindings.json***. Copy and paste the content of the file ***upAndDown.txt*** and save.<br>
